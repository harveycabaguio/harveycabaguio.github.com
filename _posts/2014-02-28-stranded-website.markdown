[http://petermoorhead.com/stranded/](STRANDED) is an indie game that needed a website to inform users what the game is, be a place to buy the game, and be a place to buy merchandise from. So I set out to make one for them.

I worked with Peter Moorhead and Cassidy James, who wrote the content of the website. I designed and built this website, using github pages to get feedback from them as I made my progress.
